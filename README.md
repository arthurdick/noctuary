# üåô The Noctuary

**A Command-Line Journal for Dream Weavers and Lucid Explorers.**

The Noctuary is a powerful, terminal-based dream journal designed for those who want to keep a detailed record of their nightly adventures. It goes beyond simple note-taking, integrating with Google's Gemini AI to provide deep analysis, identify recurring themes, and actively assist in the practice of lucid dreaming.

The name comes from the word **noctuary**, which is a journal or record of things that pass in the night‚Äîa perfect description for this tool.

  - **ü§î Personal Reflection:** Add and edit your own personal analysis for each dream with the `reflect` command, keeping your thoughts separate from the AI's interpretation.
  - **üìù Rich Content Entry:** Uses your system's default text editor (`vim`, `nano`, `notepad`, etc.) for writing detailed, multi-line dream descriptions and analyses.
  - **üîé Powerful Search & Listing:** `list` dreams by flexible date ranges (`7d`, `2025-08`, `2025-08-16`) and `search` your entire journal by keyword.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

  - PHP 8.0+
  - The `php-sqlite3` and `php-curl` extensions.
  - A Google Gemini API Key (for AI features.)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Clone this project to your local machine.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/arthurdick/noctuary
    cd noctuary
    ```

2.  **Get Your API Key**

      - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
      - Create a new API key.
      - **Important:** Keep this key private and secure.

3.  **Set the Environment Variable**
    The script reads the API key from an environment variable called `GEMINI_API_KEY`. You must set this for any of the AI features to work.

    ```sh
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    *Pro-tip: Add this line to your shell's startup file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`) to make it permanent.*

4.  **Make the Script Executable**
    Give the script execute permissions.

    ```sh
    chmod +x noctuary
    ```

5.  **Place it in Your PATH (Recommended)**
    To use `noctuary` as a global command from anywhere in your terminal, move it to a directory in your system's PATH.

    ```sh
    sudo mv noctuary /usr/local/bin/
    ```

6.  **First Run**
    The first time you run the script, it will automatically create the `dream_journal.sqlite` database file in the same directory.
